# Earthquakes-Data-Analysis
A MS Excel based data analysis project to find correlation between various attributes, perform operations, visualize data and deduce a conclusion based on the dataset.
---
Analysis performed:
1. Extracting attributes with numerical data from the dataset and preprocessing them.
2. Correlation Analysis to find magnitude of relation between factors.
3. Descriptive Statistics to summarize and understand the main features of a dataset in a simple numerical form. Measures like mean, median, mode, and sum describe the central tendency, while standard deviation, variance, range, minimum, and maximum explain data spread. Skewness, kurtosis, and standard error help assess the distribution shape, outliers, and reliability of the mean.
4. Linear Regression to model relationship between dependent and independent variable graphically.
5. Predictive Analysis to forecast earthquake magnitude values based on analysis performed in previous sheets.
6. Pivot Charts & Slicers for better understanding through visualization.
7. Conclusion
